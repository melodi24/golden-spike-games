                        <p>The games are identical to those that Deep Thought Games produces. We have been helping DTG fill orders since 2009.</p>
                        <p> We are located in Utah (hence the inspiration for the company name).
                        <p> The Engine in the photo on the top is the replica of the Central Pacific Jupiter that participated in the Golden Spike event in 1869.
                            I took the photo at the Golden Spike site at Promontory Summit, Utah, as it was steaming up the track toward the meeting point. </p>
                        <p>The photo on the bottom is from the 150th anniversary event where they re-enacted the driving of the Golden Spike.</p>

                        <h2>Expedited Orders</h2>
                        <p>Golden Spike Games offers direct, expedited orders of most of the <a class="text-link" href="http://deepthoughtgames.com/">Deep Thought Games</a> titles (all games except 1817 and 18MEX). These expedited orders are charged at a premium price.</p>
                        <p>The prices on the Deep Thought Games site have never been adjusted, so these prices reflect both adjustments for the ever-rising cost of materials as well as for being in the premium queue.</p>
                        <p><a class="text-link" href="http://www.all-aboardgames.com/">All-Aboard Games</a> offers 1817 and 18MEX.</p>
                        <p>You can still place an order for games through Deep Thought Games, but the wait time there is unknown.
                            Golden Spike Games does all the fulfillment of the Deep Thought Games orders and we won't get to the games in the DTG queue
                            until the premium orders have all been fulfilled, and some adjustment of prices will need to occur since the cost of materials keeps rising.</p>

                                <span class="news-header">22 May 2020</span> - Life is getting a bit more back to normal and several orders have shipped this week. My health is fine now and I am preparing for a 2nd degree TaeKwanDo black belt test in July. All the classes have been via video
                                for the past several months and that's been an adjustment, but life is about adjusting to changing circumstances and I think we'll all doing a great job of it. Having taken up martial arts in my 50s (after watching my kids doing
                                it for 5+years), it's been a challenge--but also very rewarding. I'll continue to crank out orders and we'll try to make inroads into the queue.

                                post-surgery. Not quite ready to start practicingTaeKwanDo yet, but getting closer. I do teach a class once a week and we are doing it online now for the next while. Life can throw unexpected curves at you. Handling
                                them and staying positive and happy is what life is all about. I hope and pray we get through this pandemic soon. Keep yourself safe and help others that need help.

                                I had my cancer surgery on March 4th and all went as expected. I'm two weeks post-op now and feeling a lot better. I've gone to feeling I've been kicked in the stomach, which is a great improvement over feeling like I've been
                                stabbed in the stomach (which I was, effectively). We'll know in about three months whether I will also need follow-up radiation treatments or if the surgery got it all. We'll deal with it if/when needed, but in the meantime life is
                                good.
                                In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, I'm making a few adjustments:

                                <ul>
                                    <li>I will email/invoice you BEFORE we start your order (at present the order is usually well underway when I send the invoice).</li>
                                    <li>If you need to cancel the order in light of a change to your financial situation I will understand. But please LET ME KNOW. Don't just ignore the emails please.</li>
                                    <li>If you want to postpone your order then I will do that. That will put your order on hold. You can email me when you are ready for it and you'll get back to your same place in the queue.</li>
                                </ul>
                                Fortunately, making games can be done while sheltering in place so we will be following all government recommendations in that respect. I can work from home for my normal job so that is also a blessing.

                                Also, I'm switching over to a new laminate since the one that I have been using since 2009 (and also what DTG and AAG games used) is no longer available. The next several orders may get some games with the old and some with the
                                new. The new is pretty good. It's still 5 mil, but it's a Matte finish instead of Satin so it's not quite as bright. It's still a ton better than using Glossy. Every supplier I checked with is discontinuing 5 mil Satin so I
                                simply couldn't find it anywhere.

                                    <p>Insurance is optional for U.S. orders, also charged at cost. International orders will automatically have insurance. I generally will insure it for $50/game up to the $200 maximum.</p>
                                    <p>If you would like to estimate your shipping costs, visit the <a class="text-link" href="https://postcalc.usps.com/">USPS website.</a></p>
                                    <p>For a <b>US order</b>, a single game will fit in a Medium Flat Rate box and two games can fit in the Large Flat Rate Box.
                                       Unless you live on the west coast, Flat Rate will usually be cheaper. For those in the West, or those orders more than two games,
                                       you can calculate the shipping from the USPS website. The shipping zip code is 84045. Enter your destination zip code, select
                                        Standard Package and enter the weight, then hit Continue. On the next screen look for the price shown under <b>Priority Mail 2-Day™</b> in
                                       the rightmost column labeled Online Price. I will use flat rate instead if it is less expensive.</p>
                                    <p>For a non-US order, select your Country, then choose Standard Package and enter the weight, then hit Continue.
                                        On the next screen look for the price shown under <b>Priority Mail International™</b> in the rightmost column labeled Online Price.</p>
                                    <p>Combining games will generally reduce the cost of shipping. This is especially true for orders outside of the United States.
                                       It generally costs as much to ship two games in separate orders as it does to ship four games all together.</p>

                            <p>Sales are Final. Shipping Insurance is optional. The buyer assumes all risks of damaged or lost packages should insurance be declined.</p>
                            <p>Customs and Duty charges for international shipments are the responsibility of the buyer.</p>
                            <p>Insurance for U.S. orders is your choice. I've only ever had two packages go completely missing.
                                One was a big one sent parcel post (with insurance, fortunately), which is one reason I don't use parcel post any more.
                                The other was delivered to a place of business and never found the employee. I've had a box or two dinged in shipping too,
                                but that's mostly cosmetic. These games are pretty sturdy. The choice of insurance is up to you.</p>
                            <p>Note that orders shipped outside of the U.S. automatically come with up to $200 of insurance.
                                I will insure them for $50/game, generally, which means an order of four games will max out the included insurance at $200.
                                There is often not an option to buy additional insurance (it varies a bit by country).</p>
                            <p>If there are missing pieces I will of course provide them. It's very rare, but can happen.</p>
